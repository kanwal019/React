# React & Next.js Learning Repository

 This repository is a personal learning workspace for React and Next.js. Use it to store example projects, notes, experiments, and small demos while you learn both frameworks.

 ## Goals

- Provide a single place to keep practice projects for React and Next.js.
- Maintain clear setup instructions and recommended commands.
- Collect useful learning resources and tips.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (recommended v18+)
- npm, yarn, or pnpm
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `react/` — contains a starter React app (Vite)
- `next/` — contains a starter Next.js app
- `notes/` — markdown notes and snippets
- `assets/` — images, design files, etc.
- `package.json` — root package configuration

## Quick Start

Starter projects are already scaffolded in `react/` and `next/`. To get started:

### React app

```pwsh
cd react
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Next.js app

```pwsh
cd next
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- Replace `npm` with `yarn` or `pnpm` if you prefer.
- Each project manages its own dependencies.

## Useful Scripts (per-project)

- `npm run dev` — Start the dev server
- `npm run build` — Build for production
- `npm run start` — Start the production server (for Next.js)
